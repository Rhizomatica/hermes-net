# Contributor Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of this project, we all pledge to treat
all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature
requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches,
and other activities with common decency at minimum.

To this end, there is to be no harassment, personal attacks, or other
trashtalking directed at any member of the community, whether over any
racial, sexual, religious, national identity, over personal grudges
towards other members from here or elsewhere. In general, most of these
forms of prohibited content involve either off topic posts, spam, or
being an asshole or a plagerist - so stay on topic, don't post spam and
don't be an asshole either to others or in general.

Note that mild trashtalk of organizations or companies as a whole (but
not individuals working there) - Microchip, Atmel, and Arduino are
certainly valid targets - but only insofar as it relates to a technical
matter already being discussed.

Also, obviously, images that are disturbing, sexual, or harassing (or
otherwise which have nothing to do with the repo) should not be posted.
No content that is illegal is to be included in any post, commit or PR.
No intimidating, threatening, advertising (whether goods, services or
political opinions - this does not prohibit brief mentions of products
sold by contributors which are that are relevant to an existing
discussion - but only if it constitutes a small portion of the post,
and the post is concerned primarily with the matter at hand, not your
commercial product).

No content that is not open source is to be submitted by anyone other
than the copyright holder. Open source code with a license incompatible
with LGPL 2.1 may be permitted, but only if it's particularly valuable,
as was done for the code from adafruitNeopixel which became tinyNeopixel.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit,
or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that
are not aligned to this Code of Conduct. Project maintainers or contributors
who do not follow the Code of Conduct may be banned temporarally or
permanently, depending on the severity of the offence. To date we have not
had any instances of such behavior.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may
be reported by emailing `spencekonde@gmail. com>` which only goes to to
Spence Konde.

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the examples cited by GitHub, which was adapted from the `Contributor
Covenant <http://contributor-covenant.org>` version 1.0.0, available at
[http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/0/0/](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/0/0/).
