# Servo Library for Arduino

This library allows an Arduino board to control RC (hobby) servo motors.

This library has been modified to add support for additional ATtiny processors. This version of the library
has `_ATTinyCore` appended to the name. This permits its use even when the normal servo library, which does
not support all of these parts, has been installed.

It presents the same API.
